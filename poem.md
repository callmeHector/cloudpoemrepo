    By Madison Julius Cawein
    
    All through the tepid Summer night
     The starless sky had poured a cool
    Monotony of pleasant rain
     In music beautiful.

    And for an hour I'd sat to watch
     Clouds moving on majestic feet,
    Had heard down avenues of night
     Their hearts of thunder beat;

    Saw ponderous limbs far-veined with gold
     Pulse fiery life o'er wood and plain,
    While scattered, fell from monstrous palms
     The largess of the rain;

    Beholding at each lightning's flash
     The generous silver on the sod,
    In meek devotion bowed, I thanked
     These almoners of God.
