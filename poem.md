By Madison Julius Cawein

:cloud:<br>
All through the tepid Summer night,<br>
The starless sky had poured a cool<br>
Monotony of pleasant rain<br>
In music beautiful.<br>

:cloud:<br>
And for an hour I'd sat to watch<br>
Clouds moving on majestic feet,<br>
Had heard down avenues of night<br>
Their hearts of thunder beat;<br>

:cloud:<br>
Saw ponderous limbs far-veined with gold<br>
Pulse fiery life o'er wood and plain,<br>
While scattered, fell from monstrous palms<br>
The largess of the rain;<br>

:cloud:<br>
Beholding at each lightning's flash<br>
The generous silver on the sod,<br>
In meek devotion bowed, I thanked<br>
These almoners of God.<br>
