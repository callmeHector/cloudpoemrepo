    By Madison Julius Cawein
    
    All through the tepid Summer night<br>
     The starless sky had poured a cool<br>
    Monotony of pleasant rain<br>
     In music beautiful.<br>

    And for an hour I'd sat to watch<br>
     Clouds moving on majestic feet,<br>
    Had heard down avenues of night<br>
     Their hearts of thunder beat;<br>

    Saw ponderous limbs far-veined with gold<br>
     Pulse fiery life o'er wood and plain,<br>
    While scattered, fell from monstrous palms<br>
     The largess of the rain;<br>

    Beholding at each lightning's flash<br>
     The generous silver on the sod,<br>
    In meek devotion bowed, I thanked<br>
     These almoners of God.<br>
