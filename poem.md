By Madison Julius Cawein

:cloud:
All through the tepid Summer night
The starless sky had poured a cool
Monotony of pleasant rain
In music beautiful.

:cloud:
And for an hour I'd sat to watch
Clouds moving on majestic feet,
Had heard down avenues of night
Their hearts of thunder beat;

:cloud:
Saw ponderous limbs far-veined with gold
Pulse fiery life o'er wood and plain,
While scattered, fell from monstrous palms
The largess of the rain;

:cloud:
Beholding at each lightning's flash
The generous silver on the sod,
In meek devotion bowed, I thanked
These almoners of God.
